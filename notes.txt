1)What is Spring?
Spring is a powerful, lightweight, open-source Java framework used to build enterprise-level applications easily and efficiently.

2) Inversion of Control (IoC)	Spring container manages object creation and their dependencies.
3) Dependency Injection (DI)	Objects are injected by the container instead of being created manually using new.

4) Spring Ecosystem Includes:
	Spring Boot – simplifies Spring application setup and deployment.

	Spring MVC – for building web applications.

	Spring Data JPA – simplifies database operations.

	Spring Security – for authentication and authorization.

	Spring Cloud – for building microservices.

	Spring Batch, Spring Integration, etc.

5) What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a framework built on top of the Spring Framework that helps developers create stand-alone, production-ready Spring applications quickly and easily, with minimal configuration.
Spring Boot simplifies Spring development by eliminating the need for complex XML configurations — it auto-configures your application based on the dependencies you add.

6) Key Features of Spring Boot
			Feature	Description
1. Auto Configuration		Automatically configures your Spring application based on the dependencies present in the classpath.
2. Starter Dependencies		Provides pre-defined dependency sets like spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, etc.
3. Embedded Servers		Comes with built-in servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow — no need for external deployment.
4. Stand-alone Applications	Just run your app with a simple main() method — no need for WAR files.
5. Actuator			Provides monitoring and management endpoints for health, metrics, and logs.
6. Production Ready		Includes features like health checks, metrics, and security by default.
7. Less Configuration		Uses annotations like @SpringBootApplication instead of long XML files.
